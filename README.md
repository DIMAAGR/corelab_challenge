### Why I Didn't use Equatable
Over the past 5 years working with Flutter, I’ve discovered something interesting: despite adding the Equatable package to nearly all of my projects, I’ve rarely seen it used in a meaningful way. Most of the time, it just sits there, "just because." For me, this doesn’t contribute to cleaner or more maintainable code; instead, it often adds an unnecessary layer of complexity to the project.

When I start a new project, I believe it’s crucial to carefully design and consider its specific needs. Adding tools or packages simply because they’re popular or widely used in bigger projects doesn’t make sense to me. Each project has its own unique requirements, and I think the architecture and standards should be tailored to meet those needs, rather than following a one-size-fits-all approach.

As Uncle Bob says, clean patterns and clean architecture should be adaptable, varying from project to project. I’ve come to realize that you can’t just pick a structure and assume it will be the best for every situation. Instead, it’s important to carefully plan and think through every decision before starting to code, ensuring that each choice is well-founded and truly necessary for the specific project at hand.
